Healthcare Service location provider 
Welcome to the repository for the website me and my team designed for intel unnati summer training. 

This project aims to show the closest healthcare services like doctors,hospitals,pharmacies etc using google places API.
It fetches current location of the user and displays the nearby services.
Our problem statement was integrated services to common people and we chose to work on delivering the healthcare services to the people.
To use this project download all the files on your system and replace "your-api-key" with API key provided by google in the pharmacies,labs,doctors,hospital.html files.
